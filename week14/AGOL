## Steps followed
1. Layers are opened in ArcGIS online as they were hosted as feature layers.
2. Tried to change the style but every time I tried to change it, but it was always asking to change the layer as web map.
3. Used “visualization” option in feature layer to change the styles.
4. Image was added in the layer style option.


##Outcomes
1. A few markers were added to the layer by using visualization option and these were displaying successfully in field maps.
2. Image added was also displayed successfully in field maps.

## Next steps
1. Try to join two layers in leaflet.
2. Display the data of these maps in leaflet.
3. Change the icon for the markers of the newly collected data in leaflet.
