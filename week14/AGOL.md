## Steps followed
1. Layers are opened in ArcGIS online as they were hosted as feature layers.
2. Tried to change the style but every time I tried to change it, it was always asking to change the layer as a web map.
3. Used the “visualization” option in the feature layer to change the styles.
4. The image was added in the layer style option.

##Outcomes
1. A few markers were added to the layer by using the visualization option and these were displayed successfully in field maps.
2. The image added was also displayed successfully in field maps.

## Next steps
1. Try to join two layers in the leaflet.
2. Display the data of these maps in the leaflet.
3. Change the icon for the markers of the newly collected data in the leaflet.
