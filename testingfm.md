2. When the app is opened, it was directly asking for location access. The GPS option is already built and there is a need for separately enabling this (This is the solution for the problem in "smartforms.md").

## Outcomes

1. The new Field map created was tested out successfully.
2. The data collected is shown in ArcGIS online. 

## Next steps

1. Add more accurate questions to smart forms.
2. Options such as “calculated expression” should be used to create more precise smart form.
3. Link this data with ArcGIS dashboard or any other ArcGIS platform so that public can access the information of the data at any time.
