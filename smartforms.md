## Steps Followed

1. A new item with two layers has been created in ArcGIS Field maps. One layer is to upload the data (point layer) and the second layer is to verify the location (polygon layer).
2. Smart forms interface in the ArcGIS field maps is depicted as below.

4. A few prebuild fields are already provided. We can add new field which are related to the project. 
5. I wanted to add automatic location detection feature (like in survey123) in the smart forms but there was no option for this. 
6. There was a problem while saving the form as it has asked to enable the public sharing option for the form for public access. The public sharing option was enabled from the settings.

## Outcomes

1. A new smart form with a few questions related to city assets has been created.
2. Sharing level of this map has been understood.

## Next steps

1. Collecting the data using this app in android mobile.
2. Testing and sharing the data that has been acquired.
