## Steps followed

•	Discussion was about template of the website and work did by each member.

## Outcomes

•	Doubts related to template of the website are cleared.
•	Each member of the team knows what everyone did.

## Resources

1. To add the work to the website template. 
2. To integrate any previous city assets data into ArcGIS online and add a new feature layer, join these to create a smart form in field maps.
3. After joining the previous data feature layer with the new feature layer, the output of both should be shown in leaflet.
